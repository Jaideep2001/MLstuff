"OctaneRatingSimpleNeNe.ipynb" is a simple neural network with one input layer, one hidden layer, and one output layer.
The hidden layer consists of only 2 nodes, which are activated by "softplus" function. This is a regression problem with a single numerical input, with a corresponding numerical output.
Given its simplicity, I have hard coded this without any in-built deep-learning commands/modules etc.
This small model can be used for any dataset with a single input and single output. However, some tuning may be required.
The model gives me an RMS error of 0.06, which is an acceptable quantity.
This is one of the very first deep-learning models I've made, and clearly understood.
